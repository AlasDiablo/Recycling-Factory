# About Recycling Factory

Recycling Factory is a mod that wants to give a second life to block and item that have no utily or available in big quantity.
To do this we take inpiration from IC2 Scrap Box and remake it with more loot and with mods integration in the future.

## What's in the Mod

For now, we have a block called Trash Can, this block works like a composter, but you can put anything in it.
and you have a 15% chance of filling a level. and after 7 levels you get a scrap.

The scrap can be used to make a Basic Scrap Box, when used with a right click or a dispenser it will drop a random item.

We also propose 3 other tier to the Scrap Box:

- Advanced: requires 9 Basic Scrap Boxes to be crafted
- Elite: requires 9 Advanced Scrap Boxes to be crafted
- Ultimate: requires 9 Elite Scrap Boxes to be crafted

Each of these Scrap Box has a different loot table with rarer items at each level.
